# fcc-group-project

## Getting started

### Clone the repo
If you've added your ssh keys to github you can use the ssh url, otherwise just copy the https url and run:

`git clone https://github.com/TomDrapes/fcc-group-project.git` 

### Install npm packages
Run the following command inside the `fcc` directory at the same location the `package.json` file is located. You only need to run this when new packages
have been added to the code that you haven't installed locally yet.

`npm install`

### Start the frontend

Inside the `fcc` directory run:

`npm start`

This will start the app in your browser on localhost.
